# OpenWordnet-PT: An Open Access Wordnet for Portuguese

## How to use it?

- You can browse or search the data in our
  [web interface](http://openwordnet-pt.org).

- You can download the RDF files and load it with any RDF library
  available for your preferable programming language.

## About the RDF 

- Based on http://www.w3.org/TR/wordnet-rdf/ and
  http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/lod/wn30/ with some modifications. More
  files from the Princeton distribution were considered and not only
  the database files. More properties and classes are included.

## Releases

Starting from 1.0.0, we are planning to make periodical releases. The
criteria for new releases will be:

- MAJOR :: systematic changes in a large set of synsets. changes in the format of the files. changes in the 
  schema of the XML/RDF used to distributed the data.

- MINOR :: occasional changes to a limited number of synsets given a periodical revision, addition
  or removal of a few synsets. mainly related to changes in words of
  synsets.

- PATCH :: correction of typos or coding errors etc.


## History of the Project

The initial version was generated by combining the following data:

- Princeton WordNet 3.0 was used to obtain English glosses and English
  terms for synset IDs.

- The unreleased 2010-12 version of [UWN]
  (http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/uwn/) and MENTA provided
  candidate terms in Portuguese, candidate glosses in Portuguese (from
  Wikipedia).

- The EuroWordNet base concept list (`5000_bc.xml`) provides the base
  concept numbers. The original file was mapped from WordNet 2.0 to
  3.0 using the mappings from [WN-Map](http://goo.gl/qg9PJt). When
  multiple mappings for a WordNet 2.0 synset existed, all possible
  WordNet 3.0 synsets were kept. Hence, there may be multiple entries
  with the same base concept number.
